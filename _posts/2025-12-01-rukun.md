A mobile-based community management platform designed to help neighborhood organizations such as Rukun Warga (RW) manage their communities effectively. The application provides free tools for handling public complaints, billing management, financial tracking, and emergency alerts. As a Backend and DevOps Engineer Intern, I contributed to building and deploying the backend API, collaborating with mobile dev team, ensuring system stability through bug fixes, performance testing, and infrastructure management.

## My Contributions

During my internship, I focused on stabilizing and improving the backend infrastructure:

- **Debugging & Version Control**: Resolved numerous issues caused by uncommitted code changes and version control inconsistencies, ensuring the codebase remained stable and synchronized across the team.
- **Code Quality**: Improved code cleanliness by refactoring legacy code, implementing consistent coding standards, and removing technical debt.
- **Database Management**: Fixed missing database schemas and attributes, ensuring data integrity and proper relationships between tables.
- **Backend Deployment**: Managed the deployment of the backend API to production, ensuring smooth integration with the mobile application.
- **Performance Testing**: Conducted load testing using JMeter to identify bottlenecks and ensure the system could handle expected user traffic.
