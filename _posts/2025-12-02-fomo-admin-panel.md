A web based comprehensive admin dashboard for managing e-commerce operations. The platform integrates content management (products, banners, landing pages, vouchers), order management (fulfillment and customer ticketing), user management, inventory tracking, and finance reporting. As a Full-stack Developer, I built and maintained core features that enable business teams to efficiently manage their e-commerce ecosystem.
