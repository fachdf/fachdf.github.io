A comprehensive platform combining e-learning, course management, seminars, and e-commerce for SUMU (Serikat Usaha Muhammadiyah) internet marketers. The platform serves as a hub where members can access educational content, participate in paid/free seminars to network with fellow marketers, and source products for their businesses. As a Full-stack Developer, I contributed to building the integrated platform that supports both learning and commerce functionalities.
