A real estate platform connecting property sales agents with potential homebuyers. Pinturumah serves as a bridge between sales professionals working with property developers and customers looking for their dream homes. The platform enhances transparency and trust by providing real-time construction progress updates, survey request capabilities, and visibility into community development—giving buyers confidence throughout their property purchase journey. As a Full-stack Developer, I managed the complete project lifecycle from requirements gathering to deployment and user training.
